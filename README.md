# PJE Process Consultation Automator TR1 Federal (Python Web Scraping)

Project created using only the Python language and the Selenium, OpenPyXl, Os, Tkinter and CustomTkinter libraries.

**Summary**: The Web Scraping method was used to access the government website PJE (Electronic Judicial Process) of TR1 (Regional Court 1) and extract all data from each Process in which a lawyer worked in this Court. After extraction, the data is formatted and inserted into an xlsx file and made available on the user's desktop.

Furthermore, a Graphical Interface was developed, where the user can enter the data used for the query: The OAB number (Brazilian Lawyer Identification) and the acronym of the State in which they work.

All data used is public knowledge and does not violate the LGPD.
